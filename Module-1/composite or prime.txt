Algorithm to find whether a number is prime or composite
1. Start
2. Accept a positive intrger 'n' { number  greater than 2 }
3. Initialize 'counter' with a value 2
4. Divide 'n' with 'counter' 
5. If the remainder is zero display that 'n' is composite and stop
6. Else increment the 'counter' and repeat from step 4 until the 'counter' value is less than 'n'
7. After completion of all the steps display that a number 'n' is prime
8. Stop
